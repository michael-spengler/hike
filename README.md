# Hike

This ERC20 shall inspire my friends to try several Layer2 solutions - see: https://blockzeit.com/ethereum-growth-check-out-the-top-7-upcoming-l2s.  

One reason is that it might help a lot of us to qualify for airdrops of those Layer2 s (many of us fortunately already got lucky with Arbitrum).   

Therefore I plan to deploy this coin on some of the following Layer2 solutions. On Modulus I plan to launch something a bit more sophisticated around the geocashingCULT.  

For a fair and transparent initial distribution I plan to give everyone 1 % of all coins who retweets the corresponding announcement (layer2 specific) - max. about 90 % because about 10 % will be transferred to some first geocashingCULT wallets.  

To check your airdrops :)

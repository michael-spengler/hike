# Hike

This ERC20 shall inspire my friends to try several Layer2 solutions - see: https://blockzeit.com/ethereum-growth-check-out-the-top-7-upcoming-l2s.  

One reason is that it might help a lot of us to qualify for airdrops of those Layer2 s (many of us fortunately already got lucky with Arbitrum).   

Therefore I plan to deploy this coin on some of the listed Layer2 solutions. On Modulus I plan to launch something a bit more sophisticated around the geocashingCULT.  

For a fair and transparent initial distribution I plan to give everyone 1 % of all coins who retweets [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Peer2peerE/status/1692097902619865177) - max. about 90 % because about 10 % will be transferred to some first geocashingCULT wallets.   

After that I plan to encourage everyone to create or enhance liquidity pools - e.g. on Polygon ZKEVM (see also https://wallet.polygon.technology/zkEVM-Bridge/bridge).  
In my opinion the Polygon zkEVM can continue to also inspire the Modulus ZKEVM (see also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5omSTWmOk).

## Attributes
Fixed Supply of 369.369.369 Coins  
Amount to be transferred to early retweeters: 3.693.693,69   
Total Amount to be transferred to some first geocashingCULT wallets: 36.936.936,9   

If some hikes remain in my wallet for more than about 10 days (e.g. because not enough people retweet the announcement) I'll create or enhance a liquidity pool with Hike.
